## What is Form D798?
 
Form D798 is an application form for renewing a photocard driving licence. You will need this form if you are renewing your licence by post and you:
 
- have a 10-year photocard licence that is due to expire within 56 days or has expired within the last 2 years
- have a 5-year bus or lorry licence that is due to expire within 56 days or has expired within the last 2 years
- want to change your name or address on your licence
- want to change your photo on your licence
- have a paper driving licence that was issued before 31 March 2000
- have a medical condition that affects your ability to drive

You do not need form D798 if you are renewing your licence online or at a participating Post Office branch. You also do not need this form if you are applying for your first provisional or full driving licence, or if you are exchanging a foreign driving licence for a UK one.
